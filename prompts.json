However, nobody seems to think of the risks that these kinds of new technologies may have. Cars have been around for many decades, and now manufacturers are starting to get on the bandwagon and come up with the new and improved technology that they hope will appeal to everyone. As of right now, it seems as though the negative characteristics of these cars consume the positive idea that these manufacturers have tried to convey.\n\nCurrently, this new technology in cars has a very long way to go before being completely \"driverless\". Drivers still need to be on alert when they are driving, as well as control the car near any accidents or complicated traffic situations. This seems to totally defeat the purpose of the \"driverless\" car. Eventually the technology may improve, but nobody can be certain that the driverless car will eventually become completely \"driverless\". This idea just seems like a lot of hard work and money for something that is not very neccessary. If someone does not want to drive their car they can just take a city bus or a subway. There are so many options of transportation that can already solve this problem. Even if masnufacturers are trying to make driving more \"fun\", driving is not meant to be \"fun\" it is meant to get people where they need to go. Playing around in a car just to have \"fun\" is just a recipe for disaster.\n\nThe idea of the driverless car also raises many questions about who will be liable when someone gets into an accident in one of these new cars. Many states do not even let people drive semi-automatic cars because there are not even laws that pertain to the liability of anyone who get into an accident while driving these type of cars. If these cars become more popular, states may pass new laws. However, this topic also raises questions about who is able to dictate whether or not it was the car or the human's fault for an accident. Since this technology is so new, there could be many problems with the car's system that nobody has even discovered since they have not drove the car themselves. If someone test drives this kind of car or even purchases one and they get into a crash not knowing what could possibly happen to them, they will want to sue the car manufacturer since they were not aware of any bugs in the car's system. These lawsuits can add up and eventually the manufactuers will be in a bunch of debt, which could cost them their whole idea of the driverless car.\n\nThe technology car manufacturers are trying to develope may just be a diasaster in the making. There are many alternative options of transportations if you do not feel like driving yourself, and these options are way less expensive than buying a brand new car. Although this technology is relatively new, we can not be certain that this new idea will even pay off in the end, it may just be a waste of money and time.

  "1_shot_high_score": "Essay of example 1\n\nFor years and years, it has been said that emotion comes from the \"heart\", when really, emotions are scientific. In a classroom setting, many students feel as if they are in an uncomfortable environment, causing them to become silent and unable to ask questions. With the use of the technology called Facial Action Coding System, the teacher is able to modify what they are teaching to ensure everybody, even those who are quiet, understand. This new technology will offer students who are shy the same education as those who are not, modify a lesson for a certain student who is confused, and allow for a more positive environement in a classroom, making it valuable for students.\n\nWhen eighteen girls and fifteen boys are put into a classroom, it is not always guranteed that they will have a friend in the class. Many times, when children do not feel welcome in an environment, they will not speak up or ask a question. This causes teachers to be unable to help the student understand what they are trying to learn. In the excerpt, \"Movement of one or more muslces is called an 'action unit'. Then Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System). Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, dear, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles\"(D'Alto 3). The technology is able to deeply read the expressions people make due to the movement of the muscles in the face. When someone has an emotion, sometimes, they unawarely show it. With FACS, the program can analyze that emotion , and give the feedback to the teacher to allow he/she to go back over the material that the student gave an emotion to. With the use of this technology, teachers can see how the students are feeling, without having to pull the answers out of the students who rarely talk.\n\nThe first thing most people notice when meeting someone for the first time or thousandth time is body language. It is scientifically proven that when someone is public speaking or talking, the focus is 90% body language/tone, and 10% material they are covering. From the way their voice is, or the way their face falls, a lot of information can be given. The new technology Facial Action Coding System allows for a computer to go deeper in analyzing the emotion of the face. A normal person is not going to immediately recognize that when the \"your oribularis oris, which is the muscle around your mouth tightens, it means you are showing anger\"(D'Alto). The new program is able to analyze the muscles to give more of a precise and accurate reading of the emotion. Teachers meet students for 53 minutes a day, and are not mind readers who know how their students are feeling. The author claims, \"For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different. 'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor'\"(D'Alto 6). Since technology is the new way of learning this century, the computer's ability to be able to recognize confusion, and help modify the lesson to help increase understanding would be very valuable. There are many times when teachers let students go off and do the notes online, and many students may not catch on. With the ability to see they are not understanding, the student will not be forced to ask the teacher, but have the computer explain it. This would substantially help the students who are afraid of questions, and those who are absent from class. Having an instructor that knows every emotion that a student is feeling, and be there if modification is needed, would have a major impact on the succsess rate of students.\n\nAs more and more technology is being woven into todays ways of learning, it is important that it is grows along with the generation. Many times, students come into class with a \"I do not want to be here\" attitude. With attitudes like that, it decreases the success of the student. In the excerpt, \"According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them.....Empathy (feeling someone else's emotional state) may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions\"(D'Alto 9). Teachers could use these known tactics and have their students practice certain facial expressions to make them feel a certain way. If they are able to make the students smile, and it can allow for a slight feeling of happiness, resulting in a more positive environment. Students will participate more when put into an environment they feel welcome, and warm in, and by using the FACS program to see if they begin to feel happy, teachers can enforce more postivity in the classroom. The positive the classroom, the more particpation there is from students.\n\nAlthough this program may not be 100% accurate since it doesn't know every emotion in the universe or what is going on in the person's brain, it can help teachers realize the basic emotions needed to see if their students are understanding. This new technology will offer students who are shy or quiet the same education as anyone else, allow for a more positive environment, and modify a lesson for a certain student if confused, overall making it very valuable for students in the classroom. \n\nScore and reason of example 1\n\nI would give this essay a score of $$6$$ because it is well-organized and maintains a clear focus on the topic, which is the potential benefits of the Facial Action Coding System in a classroom setting. The author presents three well-articulated arguments in support of the technology: it allows teachers to understand the emotions of shy students, it enables lesson modification to aid student comprehension, and it fosters a positive environment. \n\nThe essay demonstrates clear coherence and smooth progression of ideas. The writer transitions seamlessly from one point to the next, building on their argument in each paragraph, and effectively wraps up their points in the conclusion.\n\nThe use of language is skillful and the vocabulary is varied, accurate, and suitable for the context. The writer includes direct quotes from sources, indicating strong research skills and lending credibility to their argument.\n\nThe essay exhibits a meaningful variety in sentence structure, keeping the reader engaged. Finally, the work is largely free of errors in grammar, usage, and mechanics which aids in maintaining the clarity and flow of the essay. Overall, the essay meets the criteria required for a score of 6 according to the given rubrics.",

As of right now, it seems as though the negative characteristics of these cars consume the positive idea that these manufacturers have tried to convey.\n\nCurrently, this new technology in cars has a very long way to go before being completely \"driverless\". Drivers still need to be on alert when they are driving, as well as control the car near any accidents or complicated traffic situations. This seems to totally defeat the purpose of the \"driverless\" car. Eventually the technology may improve, but nobody can be certain that the driverless car will eventually become completely \"driverless\". This idea just seems like a lot of hard work and money for something that is not very neccessary. If someone does not want to drive their car they can just take a city bus or a subway. There are so many options of transportation that can already solve this problem. Even if masnufacturers are trying to make driving more \"fun\", driving is not meant to be \"fun\" it is meant to get people where they need to go. Playing around in a car just to have \"fun\" is just a recipe for disaster.\n\nThe idea of the driverless car also raises many questions about who will be liable when someone gets into an accident in one of these new cars. Many states do not even let people drive semi-automatic cars because there are not even laws that pertain to the liability of anyone who get into an accident while driving these type of cars. If these cars become more popular, states may pass new laws. However, this topic also raises questions about who is able to dictate whether or not it was the car or the human's fault for an accident. Since this technology is so new, there could be many problems with the car's system that nobody has even discovered since they have not drove the car themselves. If someone test drives this kind of car or even purchases one and they get into a crash not knowing what could possibly happen to them, they will want to sue the car manufacturer since they were not aware of any bugs in the car's system. These lawsuits can add up and eventually the manufactuers will be in a bunch of debt, which could cost them their whole idea of the driverless car.\n\nThe technology car manufacturers are trying to develope may just be a diasaster in the making. There are many alternative options of transportations if you do not feel like driving yourself, and these options are way less expensive than buying a brand new car. Although this technology is relatively new, we can not be certain that this new idea will even pay off in the end, it may just be a waste of money and time. Sometimes the newest technology is not the most benefical.         \n\nScore and reason of example 1\n\nI would give this essay a score of $$4$$ due to the following reasons:\n\n1. The essay is generally organized and focused with an understandable argument against the advent of driverless cars. It progresses from general considerations about new technologies to specific concerns about driverless cars.\n\n2. Coherence and progression of ideas could be seen, though it doesn't flow as smoothly as it would in a higher-scoring essay. There's a logical flow from one paragraph to the other, but some of the transitions between ideas could be clearer.\n\n3. While many parts of the essay showed reasonable command over language and vocabulary, some sentences had awkward phrasing or minor misuse of words. Some misuse and misspellings (e.g. \"neccessary\", \"masnufacturers\") can be noted which demonstrates inconsistency in the writer's use of language.\n\n4. Variety in sentence structure is somewhat exhibited in the essay but improvements could be made to enhance reader engagement. \n\n5. The essay contains errors in grammar, usage, and mechanics which probably affected its overall quality. Examples include missing word at '...many problems with the car's system that nobody has even discovered since they have not drove the car themselves.', wrong spelling such as \"masnufacturers\" instead of \"manufacturers\", \"develope\" instead of \"develop\", and \"diasaster\" instead of \"disaster\". \n\nThe score of 4 indicates that while the essay has achieved a reasonable effort at articulating and structuring an argument, there were inconsistent elements of language usage and present errors in grammar, spelling and structure.\n\nEssay of example 2\n\nFor years and years, it has been said that emotion comes from the \"heart\", when really, emotions are scientific. In a classroom setting, many students feel as if they are in an uncomfortable environment, causing them to become silent and unable to ask questions. With the use of the technology called Facial Action Coding System, the teacher is able to modify what they are teaching to ensure everybody, even those who are quiet, understand. This new technology will offer students who are shy the same education as those who are not, modify a lesson for a certain student who is confused, and allow for a more positive environement in a classroom, making it valuable for students.\n\nWhen eighteen girls and fifteen boys are put into a classroom, it is not always guranteed that they will have a friend in the class. Many times, when children do not feel welcome in an environment, they will not speak up or ask a question. This causes teachers to be unable to help the student understand what they are trying to learn. In the excerpt, \"Movement of one or more muslces is called an 'action unit'. Then Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System). Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, dear, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles\"(D'Alto 3). The technology is able to deeply read the expressions people make due to the movement of the muscles in the face. When someone has an emotion, sometimes, they unawarely show it. With FACS, the program can analyze that emotion , and give the feedback to the teacher to allow he/she to go back over the material that the student gave an emotion to. With the use of this technology, teachers can see how the students are feeling, without having to pull the answers out of the students who rarely talk.\n\nThe first thing most people notice when meeting someone for the first time or thousandth time is body language. It is scientifically proven that when someone is public speaking or talking, the focus is 90% body language/tone, and 10% material they are covering. From the way their voice is, or the way their face falls, a lot of information can be given. The new technology Facial Action Coding System allows for a computer to go deeper in analyzing the emotion of the face. A normal person is not going to immediately recognize that when the \"your oribularis oris, which is the muscle around your mouth tightens, it means you are showing anger\"(D'Alto). The new program is able to analyze the muscles to give more of a precise and accurate reading of the emotion. Teachers meet students for 53 minutes a day, and are not mind readers who know how their students are feeling. The author claims, \"For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different. 'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor'\"(D'Alto 6). Since technology is the new way of learning this century, the computer's ability to be able to recognize confusion, and help modify the lesson to help increase understanding would be very valuable. There are many times when teachers let students go off and do the notes online, and many students may not catch on. With the ability to see they are not understanding, the student will not be forced to ask the teacher, but have the computer explain it. This would substantially help the students who are afraid of questions, and those who are absent from class. Having an instructor that knows every emotion that a student is feeling, and be there if modification is needed, would have a major impact on the succsess rate of students.\n\nAs more and more technology is being woven into todays ways of learning, it is important that it is grows along with the generation. Many times, students come into class with a \"I do not want to be here\" attitude. With attitudes like that, it decreases the success of the student. In the excerpt, \"According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them.....Empathy (feeling someone else's emotional state) may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions\"(D'Alto 9). Teachers could use these known tactics and have their students practice certain facial expressions to make them feel a certain way. If they are able to make the students smile, and it can allow for a slight feeling of happiness, resulting in a more positive environment. Students will participate more when put into an environment they feel welcome, and warm in, and by using the FACS program to see if they begin to feel happy, teachers can enforce more postivity in the classroom. The positive the classroom, the more particpation there is from students.\n\nAlthough this program may not be 100% accurate since it doesn't know every emotion in the universe or what is going on in the person's brain, it can help teachers realize the basic emotions needed to see if their students are understanding. This new technology will offer students who are shy or quiet the same education as anyone else, allow for a more positive environment, and modify a lesson for a certain student if confused, overall making it very valuable for students in the classroom. \n\nScore and reason of example 2\n\nI would give this essay a score of $$6$$ because it is well-organized and maintains a clear focus on the topic, which is the potential benefits of the Facial Action Coding System in a classroom setting. The author presents three well-articulated arguments in support of the technology: it allows teachers to understand the emotions of shy students, it enables lesson modification to aid student comprehension, and it fosters a positive environment. \n\nThe essay demonstrates clear coherence and smooth progression of ideas. The writer transitions seamlessly from one point to the next, building on their argument in each paragraph, and effectively wraps up their points in the conclusion.\n\nThe use of language is skillful and the vocabulary is varied, accurate, and suitable for the context. The writer includes direct quotes from sources, indicating strong research skills and lending credibility to their argument.\n\nThe essay exhibits a meaningful variety in sentence structure, keeping the reader engaged. Finally, the work is largely free of errors in grammar, usage, and mechanics which aids in maintaining the clarity and flow of the essay. Overall, the essay meets the criteria required for a score of 6 according to the given rubrics.",
  "3_shot": "Essay of example 1\n\nThe posibilty of a face reconizing computer would be very helpful for children or even adults. Its would be helpful in a ways of satifying our needs and why showing us thing that would make going on the internet better.\n\nI think that the face reconizing computer would be very reliable; because in the text its says \" A class room computer could recognize when a student is confused or bored\". And if the students is \"confused and bored\" then the students is not really learning anything, beacuse all children can't be taught the same way. Some children have trouble learning or its harder for those children to learn; in a result of failing grades and low participation happening in the classroom.\n\nIn my conclusion I think that face reconizing computers would the best thing for students. In way if a students were to not understand what her/she is learning in class the face reconizing computer could realize that the child doesn't understand is and give more instructions on what to do for the topic or assingment the're doing.\n\nScore and reason of example 1\n\nI would give this essay a score of $$2$$ due to its numerous grammatical errors, usage and mechanical errors, incorrect word choices, and lack of clarity that obscures the overall meaning. The essay has minimal organization and the progression of ideas is not always logical or clear. There are numerous spelling and typographical errors (examples include: \"posibilty\" instead of possibility, \"reconizing\" instead of recognizing, \"its\" instead of \"it\", \"beacuse\" instead of \"because\" and \"thing\" instead of \"things\"). Additionally, the essay uses very limited vocabulary, lacks variety in sentence structure, and doesn't provide sufficient or appropriate examples to support its argument. Finally, the essay uses very limited transitions and connections between ideas, further causing confusion in the progression of ideas.\n\nEssay of example 2\n\nPeople always wish they had the same technology that they have seen in movies, or the best new piece of technology that is all over social media.
