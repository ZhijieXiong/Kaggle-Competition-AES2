The intervals between grades are equal.\n\nA score of 6 indicates exemplary work with clear, substantial mastery. Such an essay is characterized by insightful development of a viewpoint, outstanding critical thinking, valid and relevant evidence, clear focus, skillful language usage, and relatively few minor errors.\n\nA 5-scored essay shows consistent, though not flawless, mastery. It possesses strong critical thinking, generally appropriate examples, good organization, apt language usage, and infrequent errors.\n\nAn essay scoring 4 demonstrates adequate mastery, with lapses in quality. It has competent critical thinking, sufficient examples, acceptable organization, generally appropriate language usage, but with some errors.\n\nEssays with a score of 3 display developing mastery, marred by one or more weakness including inconsistent or inadequate development of a point of view, insufficiencies in organization or focus, weak vocabulary, sentence structure problems and accumulation of grammatical errors.\n\nA score of 2 signifies little mastery, with evident weaknesses such as a vague or limited point of view, inappropriate or insufficient evidence, poor organization, severe problems with coherence or progression of ideas, and serious errors in grammar or usage.\n\nA score of 1 is indicative of extremely limited or no mastery. Such essays are marked by the absence or inadequacy of a viable point of view, or evidence supporting it; disorganization leading to a disjointed or incoherent essay; and grave errors in vocabulary or sentence structure, along with pervasive grammar, usage or mechanical errors that majorly hamper the conveyed meaning.\n\nThis is the scoring rubric for independent writing:\nThis is the guidelines for independent writing. It follows a grading scale from 1 to 6. Each grade has specific parameters regarding the quality of the essay, divided into different domains like critical thinking, language usage, coherence, and grammatical correctness.\n\nA '6' score essay shows near complete mastery, with minor errors. It develops a notion effectively, demonstrating outstanding critical thinking using appropriate examples and evidence. Such an essay showcases proficient use of language, with varied, accurate vocabulary, and a varied sentence structure. Most grammar, usage, and mechanics are error-free.\n\nA '5' score essay exhibits reasonably consistent mastery with occasional errors or lapses in quality. It uses appropriate examples and evidence to support its critique and presents a coherent flow of ideas. It uses appropriate vocabulary, demonstrates sentence structure variety, and is mostly free from grammar and usage errors.\n\nA '4' score essay indicates adequate mastery, with occasional quality lapses. It uses satisfactory examples and reasons to support its critique. It displays some coherence in idea progression and may inconsistently use apt vocabulary. Errors in grammar, usage, and mechanics are possible.\n\nA '3' score essay shows developing mastery but has one or more notable weaknesses. It may inconsistently develop its critique or use inadequate examples or evidence to back its argument. The essay organization and focus may be limited with issues in coherence, vocabulary, and sentence structure. Grammatical, usage, and mechanical errors are possible.\n\nA '2' score essay demonstrates limited mastery, characterized by one or more significant flaws. It may discuss the subject vaguely, show weak critical thinking, and inappropriate or insufficient evidence for its position. It may show serious problems in coherence, limited vocabulary usage, incorrect word choice, and frequent structural errors. Grammar, usage, and mechanics errors may partially obscure meaning.\n\nA '1' score essay shows little or no mastery, marked by severe flaws. It lacks a viable point of view or evidence to support its position. The essay is disorganized or unfocused and contains pervasive errors in vocabulary, sentence structure, grammar, and usage, which persistently impede understanding.\n\nPlease give your score directly (wrap it with two $$ signs, such as $$4$$) and give the reason for this score. For example: `$$4$$. The reason for giving this score is ...`\n\n",
