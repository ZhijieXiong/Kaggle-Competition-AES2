The thing they don't know is that when you use a car alot of thing can happen\u00a0like you can get in accidet or\u00a0the smoke that the car has is bad to breath\u00a0on if someone is walk but in VAUBAN,Germany they dont have that proble because 70 percent of vauban's families do not own cars,and 57 percent sold a car to move there. Street parkig ,driveways and home garages are forbidden\u00a0on the outskirts of freiburd that near the French and Swiss borders. You probaly won't see a car in Vauban's streets because they are completely \"car free\" but\u00a0If some that lives in VAUBAN that owns a car ownership is allowed,but there are only two places that you can park a large garages at the edge of the development,where a car owner buys a space but it not cheap to buy one they sell the space for you car for $40,000 along with a home. The vauban people completed this in 2006 ,they said that this an example of a growing trend in Europe,The untile states and some where else are suburban life from auto use this is called \"smart planning\". The current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailes the passengee cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car intensive in the United States. I honeslty think that good idea that they did that is Vaudan because that makes cities denser and better for walking and in VAUBAN there are 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile. In the artical David Gold berg said that \"All of our development since World war 2 has been centered on the cars,and that will have to change\" and i think that was very true what David Gold said because alot thing we need cars to do we can go anyway were with out cars beacuse some people are a very lazy to walk to place thats why they alot of people use car and i think that it was a good idea that that they did that in VAUBAN so people can see how we really don't need car to go to place from place because we can walk from were we need to go or we can ride bycles with out the use of a car. It good that they are doing that if you thik about your help the earth in way and thats a very good thing to. In the United states ,the Environmental protection Agency is promoting what is called \"car reduced\"communtunties,and the legislators are starting to act,if cautiously. Maany experts expect pubic transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six years federal transportation bill to approved this year. In previous bill,80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transports. There many good reason why they should do this.    ",

By sharing my information about this isue i will tell you just that.\n\nFirst off, how could it be a martions drawing. There is no plant life on mars as of rite now that we know of, which means so far as we know it is not possible for any type of life. That explains how it could not be made by martians. Also why and how would a martion build a face so big. It just does not make any since that a martian did this.\n\nNext, why it is a landform. There are many landforms that are weird here in America, and there is also landforms all around the whole Earth. Many of them look like something we can relate to like a snake a turtle a human... So if there are landforms on earth dont you think landforms are on mars to? Of course! why not? It's just unique that the landform on Mars looks like a human face. Also if there was martians and they were trying to get our attention dont you think we would have saw one by now?\n\nFinaly, why you should listen to me. You should listen to me because i am a member of NASA and i've been dealing with all of this stuff that were talking about and people who say martians did this have no relation with NASA and have never worked with anything to relate to this landform. One last thing is that everyone working at NASA says the same thing i say, that the \"face\" is just a landform.\n\nTo sum all this up the \"face\" on mars is a landform but others would like to beleive it's a martian sculpture. Which every one that works at NASA says it's a landform and they are all the ones working on the planet and taking pictures.",

    "full_text": "People always wish they had the same technology that they have seen in movies, or the best new piece of technology that is all over social media. However, nobody seems to think of the risks that these kinds of new technologies may have. Cars have been around for many decades, and now manufacturers are starting to get on the bandwagon and come up with the new and improved technology that they hope will appeal to everyone. As of right now, it seems as though the negative characteristics of these cars consume the positive idea that these manufacturers have tried to convey.\n\nCurrently, this new technology in cars has a very long way to go before being completely \"driverless\". Drivers still need to be on alert when they are driving, as well as control the car near any accidents or complicated traffic situations. This seems to totally defeat the purpose of the \"driverless\" car. Eventually the technology may improve, but nobody can be certain that the driverless car will eventually become completely \"driverless\". This idea just seems like a lot of hard work and money for something that is not very neccessary. If someone does not want to drive their car they can just take a city bus or a subway. There are so many options of transportation that can already solve this problem. Even if masnufacturers are trying to make driving more \"fun\", driving is not meant to be \"fun\" it is meant to get people where they need to go. Playing around in a car just to have \"fun\" is just a recipe for disaster.\n\nThe idea of the driverless car also raises many questions about who will be liable when someone gets into an accident in one of these new cars. Many states do not even let people drive semi-automatic cars because there are not even laws that pertain to the liability of anyone who get into an accident while driving these type of cars. If these cars become more popular, states may pass new laws. However, this topic also raises questions about who is able to dictate whether or not it was the car or the human's fault for an accident. Since this technology is so new, there could be many problems with the car's system that nobody has even discovered since they have not drove the car themselves. If someone test drives this kind of car or even purchases one and they get into a crash not knowing what could possibly happen to them, they will want to sue the car manufacturer since they were not aware of any bugs in the car's system. These lawsuits can add up and eventually the manufactuers will be in a bunch of debt, which could cost them their whole idea of the driverless car.\n\nThe technology car manufacturers are trying to develope may just be a diasaster in the making. There are many alternative options of transportations if you do not feel like driving yourself, and these options are way less expensive than buying a brand new car. Although this technology is relatively new, we can not be certain that this new idea will even pay off in the end, it may just be a waste of money and time. Sometimes the newest technology is not the most benefical.         ",

Through this article, the author uses evidences appealing to reason and concession to make us realize why we should care about studying this planet so that people must give a chance to Venus.\n\nVenus is the closest planet to Earth in terms density and size but has a really different climate. As it is evoked by the author:\n\n( 3) \"A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus\u2019s atmosphere. On the planet\u2019s surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit....Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.\" The author uses of concession tell us what is the actual climate of Venus. He tell us the truth, he support the fact that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit but he also recognize that there's a danger present continuously. And because he support the idea of studying Venus, he proposes ways to study the planet and find a solution at a reasonable distance.\n\nVenus is an inhospitable planet that can almost be considered as an impossible dwelling for humans. But for the author, that can't keep scientist to do their job (studying Venus) : (5) \"NASA\u2019s possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth.\" Through this evidence, appealing to reasonning, the author talk about the NASA's possible solution to raise his credibility. But also, to convince the audience that we can only find a solution by studying the planet.\n\nIn conclusion, despite of Venus hostility put in advance by the concession, the author makes the audience realize that there's a solution but that we can find it only if we study the planet. He make us find out that challenge and curiosity is part of human life. But also that danger and fear should not stop us from discovering new things. After all, we are Humans.",

A non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be [overruled] by declaring the canaditdate who receives the most populare votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a method sense.It is the electors who elect the the president ,not the people. But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed).\n\nAnother, reason I am in favor of keeping the Electoral College is because, a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible. But it is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. But it is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning canadate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote.\n\nLast but not least, I am in favor of keeping the Electoral College is because, the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virue of the mal apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. A larger state gets more attintion from presidential canadidates in a campaign than a small state does. It can be argued that Electoral College methods of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a canadidates who has no hope of carrying their state.

    "full_text": "If I were to choose between keeping the electoral college or abolishing it, I would chose for abolishing it. The electoral college has a system that can be considered confusing to most americans. This system indirectly transfers citizen's votes to congress. This allows for loopholes and sabaotage to be commited during the process of electing a president.\n\nI propose abolishing the electoral college and replacing it with a simpler system that appeals to all united states citizens instead of just certain citizens. Based on phrases in the passage, there is evidence that the electoral college system is corrupt. An example would be:\n\nBack in 1960. segregationalists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in relpacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.)\n\n-source 2, second paragraph.\n\nThis is stating that in 1960 people who opposed Kennedy nearly became his electors. So if they succeeded in becoming his electors his votes would have gone to another opposing candidate. This could not happen with a system of voting that directly conected everyones votes with congress. This was a clear case of sabotage in the election of 1960.\n\nVotes in larger states and smaller states are balanced out so the number of votes would not be based on the number of people in the states. This can be seen as a way to make sure that state votes did not compare to the population of said states. In reality it is limiting the votes of citizens. If people ignored how larger states had more people than smaller states and just thought of everyone as individuals everyone would have a say. The system I am proposing does not view states as the voters, but every american citizen as one. After everyone passed their votes, they would all be tallied and which ever candidate had the most votes would win.\n\nYou may think that the votes could be sabotaged, and that politicians could put in fake votes and get rid of real ones. This problem could be dealt with by maximized security. There would be videocameras wherever the votes could be swaped.\n\nI propose this system to ensure that every citizen has a vote, and that corruption while transitioning the votes would be eliminated. This would be a less confusing system that could make voting more efficient.       \u00a0    ",

First how would these computers like programs know when to go or turn at a stop light? This could create many dangers and conflicts on the road. Next how could these computers detect humans? If the car doesn't know a person is j walking it could run over the person and possibly kill them, and yes j walking is illegal but it still happens. Finally i don't think these computers are a good idea because of malfunction. If something goes wrong in the car or the brakes go out it can lead to death for the passenger. I just think these vehicles are a little way to risky and not safe. In the article it says these cars need to be proven more safe. So this means these cars are not safe at the moment.

    "full_text": "I agree that driverless cars are a developing idea. I do like the fact that these cars should be used by the public. They could lead us to a whole other revolutionary idea with the way the human race lives our lives. It could help us all out with our neccessaties. Also it could help us with other sciences in our lives such as medical assisstants and drivers. Next, the ability to drive without a driver could help us alll in the aspect of the way on how we live our lives.\n\nFirst, for example in the text paragraph 7 it says how the company of BMW has made the \"Trafiic Jam Assisstant\" which could help us drive up to 25 mph without the need to do anything at all. Driverless cars dont just help us at drving it helps us at being smarter. The science put into these cars to drive without any work is fascinating. If we could put that same science in other fields justy as medical, then the possibilites are endless. We could have assisstant doctors getting us tools that we need,when we need them, and alarming us when something is wrong.\n\nNext, these cars are fantastic for elderly people who are unable to drive by themselves. They offer a sugnificant amount of assisstants for them so they dont have to rely on anyone else. Next, it could help keep us safe in our cars. For example, in the article in paragraph 7 it also states that these new cars have developed a drivers seat that \"vibrates\" when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. These cars can reduce the amount of vehicle incidents very much. Not only can they stop us from backing in to something but they can also stop us from being killed.\n\nAfter that, they have video cameras also in every corner of the car to help the driver sense any danger around them. For Instance, in parapraph 4 they tell of how they have a \"spinning sensor on the roof that uses laser beams to form a constantly updated 3-d model of the car and it's surrounding. They need all of these so it could act as if a human being was in the driver's seat. Further more, these \"newer cars\" dont just give us new abilities, but also the new knowledge. They show us what needs improvement and what doesn't. Also, they help us guide our way to safety if we are lost.\n\nTo inculde, these cars could also lead us to anywhere we need. This is very important in case someone gets lost. For example, if someone is lost on a camping trip and is in the wrong spot there and needs assisstance, then there car could lead then to safety and tell them exactly where they are located. It could also serve as a discovery unit. For instance, if someone is in a new town or city then they need to know where the gas station, hotel, restaurant, etc are and there car would take them there. They would help them navigate to whereever there destination might be.\n\nIn conclusion, the need for cars that do not need a driver is very important to our everyday lives. They would help navigate, save, and make our lives easier. They would help our economy out tremendoulsy by reducing accidents and the death rate. Next, they would help with people who need it such as elderly and disabled people. Last, these cars are getting closer and closer to becoming a part of our daily lives already, because we have the science that helped us develop these types of cars now.",

Out of the 538 elecors they only need 270 votes to elect a president. Why not let the people (who go through tougher times than government officials) get the votes to elect the president. Each candidate that is running for president has their own group of electors who would rather vote for their candidate so they can get a big fat paycheck, instead of actually sitting down and trying to decide who is the most qualified to run this country. There are others who think like me too, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election instead of having suck up electors who don't even think about the people of the country. They do what they do best. Do you wnt to know what it is? They are suck ups for the candidate from their state (or to whomever has the most money).\n\nThere are some people who are going to say that the electoral colledge is a good way to elect our president and I understand that.\n\nThe electoral colledge might be a good thing because it consists of qualified government hired officials instead of everyday commoners like us.

Such as if they were to go to the junk yard the junk yards would overflow and they would have to make more and more and less places to build houses or less crops for farmers.\n\nMy last reason is pollution.

If they were to change gas into something else and something went wrong with the gas or something to run the cars, they would either blow up or cause to much pollution that they would have to refund all the people and people would stop buying these because they wouldn't trust them.\n\nThat's why i say no to driveless cars.

However, the essay has a noticeable number of typos and some minor grammar errors (for example, \"gastations\" instead of \"gas stations\"), which suggests that the essay is not flawless. As a result, the essay should be given a score of 5"

    "full_text": "I don't like the idea of driveless cars. I feel like if a human can do it we should. Especially when it comes to things like that. like the idea of robots, would you really want something cleaning for you and taking care of older folks and children. I do think they are a good idea for the blind and people not going to far. Like since i live in Indiana, they would be a good idea for people in Indianapolis to get from the mall to like a resturant or something. Nothing major or far like driving from Indiana to California, not a good idea. I just don't trust things like that.\n\nDriveless cars are sort of a good idea. they're are many pros and cons about the whole thing. I feel like they are dangerous because they could malfuncting and blow up or something. Or they will drive right into a buliding at full speed or something. No car is really safe in general, but letting a robot like thing drive your car is kinda a crazy idea. Another con is that they can't really drive by itself, it still needs you to hold the steering wheel and take control when around accident ot people working on roads. I feel like if they want to have driving cars they should just bulid a car that can drive people instead of a car that half does it. Another con is that they are basically illlegal in most states except a couple. Would we have to visit somewhere else to expericence what crazy technology the world has for us now. I also think they are a bad idea because driving are probably going to be directly on their phone, no hand on the steering wheel or anything. And like it says, when the car needs you to take over it will tell you to take over. But i feel like people will just ignore it and get into accidents they could have prevented.\n\nPros are that you can half drive. You wouldn't have to really pay attention to anything around you and you could just relax while driving. ",

This is an interesting way to understand a indivuals emotional expressions. Children in this mordern day have a tendency of hiding some deep emotions and expressional feelings from their peers,friends,and family. Being able to figure out some of their emotions could save a lot of problems long term.\n\nThe worst thing a person can do is hide their emotions from people. This can really lead to a bad depression or other sad emotional syndromes. In the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\" by Nick D'Alto it stated that \"Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy,worried, etc.\" This shows that a person understanding someone emotions is very diffucult. People can hide their feelings really well especially students when even they are having their worst day.\n\nFacial action coding system can really help adults to understand the true emotions of a student. The story says that \"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts. \"Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human insturctor.\" This by far is an excellent idea. In the US in today's world a lot of students homework is online. Not even just homework at school but in everyday life it has something to do with technology.\n\nBy being said the students that can't comprehend the lesson, there can be an alternative assignment that they can to so at least they are learning something. Doing something that you kind of know and bettering yourself at that is way more benefical then doing something you have no knowledge of. A lot of students don't ask for help when they are struggling with a assignment. Most of the time they either skip it or copy down answer without getting the full structure of the material. If the students are not understanding something in a lesson the material is only going to get way harder for them without any help.\n\nIn the end, the facial coding system is a great creation and will be very benefical toward students. Teachers a very educated and have the Knowledge to help the students. If they don't know who is struggling though at all times they can't help every student.                                                   ",

    "full_text": "Many people in todays society tend to travel by car, but there is advantages to limiting car usage. Limiting car usage can stop pollution, and puts people in general in a more active environment. So, there are many other ways of transportation.\n\nIn the article, 'Car-Free Cities' it talks a lot about the advantanges of not driving a car. For example, according to the passage \"Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occaional distant motor.\" This being said, you can conclude that more people are being more active. Furthermore, the passage says \"Passenger cars are respondible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States.\" This meaning that some places in the United states gases are half of the areas pollution.\n\nThere are many more advantages to limiting car usages, and if other people do it so will the world. For example, according to the passage \"Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangle square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life.\" Moreover, in the passage it also says \"But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking.\" Furthermore, \"In this new approach, store are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distance highway.\" This meaning the world has a solution to solve the usage of cars. By making suburbs you will be walking distance away from your destination. This also saves so much money, if you were to drive you would have to waste gas. It is also more of a benefit for one who walks, rides their bike, or runs by giving them the benefit of exercise.\n\nBy limiting the usage of cars, bike trails, parks, and sports centers have been a big hit. For example, according to the passage, \"The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid-1990s.\" Moreover, \"It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicylce paths.\" This being said, the need to make such a long bike path means that more people are joining in on the limiting usage of cars, which is a benefit for us humans, and the fresh air that we breathe. People are also becoming more active, for example according to the passage \"Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaces by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic;\" Since the parks and sports centers have been blooming people are being more active. New side walks are being replaced so people can actually walk on them, the cut of traffic means less people are driving. In big cities, it just might be faster to get to your destination by riding a bike.\n\nIn conclusion, there are so many advantages to limiting car usage. It helps by lowering the percent of pollution, on top of that it also helps save money. By walking or riding your bike to your destination can benefit you in many ways. It also helps by making the world a better place. People seem to be happier when they see other being active, so the next time one thinks to drive a walking distance, rethink your decision.    ",

The temperatures average is over eight-hundred degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is ninety times more than what humans experience on earth.\n\nAlthrough, the conditions are extreme. The author gives reasons to visit and research more about Venus. As stated, \" Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system.\" The author states that they are very amazed how Venus could have been the most similar to Earth. The author continues by describing Venus with similar Earth features, \"The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar fetures such as valley, mountains, ans craters.\" Next, the author states that Nasa is already working on making a spacecraft to last long on Venus. As said, \" For example, some simplifield electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions.\" Nasa is already planning to visit Venus for research.\n\nOverall, the author supported his idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers by giving reasons and telling how Venus could be very similar to a Earth-like planet.

All citizens should participate in this program. In this essay, I will explain why this program should include you in the next trip overseas.\n\nWhen having deep affection for men and women who have served in wars such as World War Two, you long to give help back to them in repayment. That is why it feels so amazing to sail overseas with vital needs for discouraged people, such as animals or food. I have served for nine trips(the longest contributed by any Seagoing Cowboy), because it gives yourself satisfaction to keep youself busy with activities that lift people's spirits. If you join this program, you can feel like a warrior in different ways.\n\nOn these trips overseas, you can also live through rewarding and beautiful sites. With our free time in other countries, we had the opprotunities to see the Acropolis in Greece, and parts of China. We also got to experience what a gondola ride in Italy felt like through streets of water. Visualizing these historic places really make you want to see more of the world, and keep helping our world's health.\n\nPeople opposed to the UNRRA may have many doubts why you would risk the danger and time. It is true that you sail where destructive and gruesome battles have taken place, but you can visualize the importance of why you need to help those citizens who have lost so much. Even though some may also state that it is too much scrificed time away from home, the time goes by fast while playing fun and relaxing games such as:fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and tennis tournaments. There are many reasons why you can make up for risks and sacrifices on this trip to pass time or feel more connected to your service.\n\nBecuase of the ways this trip is so benificial to participants, it is a great program to take part in. Seeing beautiful sites and repaying soldiers help you analyze so much more about other places and war. For many people, it concludes as an opprotunity of a lifetime, that will never be forgotten. For these reasons, all citizens should participate in the UNRRA program overseas.",

Driverless cars could have less accidents, save gas, and maybe even get people where they need to be quicker.\n\nTheoretically thinking, a driverless vehicle could potentially cause a lot less trouble than a vehicle with a human driver. Sometimes, humans don't tend to make the best choices ever. Every year many people die because of drunk drivers alone. Many people also die just because some idiot decided they didn't need to pay attention, that text was just too important or than phone call may have been too important. More important than someones life of course. With driverless cars they would not have to worry about any of that, as long as they knew where they were going the car would get them there and back safely.\n\nWhat's even better than a car you don't have to worry about driving? A car you don't have to worry about driving, while saving gas. According to the text, Mr Sergey Brin forsees cars that would use half the fuel that taxis use in todays world. Even if it wasnt much, if you add up everyone that rides taxis it accumulates and eventually everyones contributing to the problem. So a car that could use only half of the gas we use today, like is there any reason to say no to these cars?\n\nMany people almost never get anywhere on time, some may have too much going on some might just not care. Whatever the case may be, what if these driverless cars could get you wherever you needed to be in the quickest way possible while not breaking the law. The driverless car could get you where you need to get by taking the quickest route possible. With all the advanced technology being promised the car could know whats ahead of it and if it will slow your trip down. For example if the car knows that up ahead is construction zone where you would have to slow down and waste time, it could just take a more efficient way and eventually save you time.\n\nDriverless cars, hopefully soon, will no longer be a thing of the past. With technology just advancing without stopping i think soon driverless cars would just be another normal vehicle you see on the road. To me driverless cars would be an astounding idea. ",

They have simplified electronicsthat are made of \"silicon carbide\" that have been tested in a chamber that is like Venus's surface, and has lasted for about 3 weeks in the comditons as Venus's surface. They still are working on other inventions that will allow the machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully knowledge of Venus. NASA has also wanted a ship to orbit and hover safely far above the planet so that it can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of photography and videography of Venus. Astronomers have wanted to return to Venus but they wasnt a mission safe and scientifically productive. Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because they believe in the solar sytem long ago Venus was like was just like Earth at one point. They also believe that Venus once had the features like eath like an ocean, mountains, valleys, and craters. In Venusian geology and weather present erupting volcanoes and frquent lighting , and maybe even strikes on the land surfaces. Venus atomosphere is about 97 percent of carbon dioxide and has a highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. Its temaptures are an average over 800 degrees , its atmospheric pressure is 90 times greather that we experience on our own planet. Each pervious mission was unmanned and maybe thats a good reason no spacecraft survived the landing, or ecplains why not a single spaceship hs touched down on Venus in more than three decases. And is why Astonomers have also wanted a safe mission to go to Venus. And it is also why its a challenging planet for humans to study,which is like is said before why NASA has been wantiing to find good ways to study Venus.

Yet they will trust a car to drive itself and have no problem? The car you are driving could have miscalculations and make a turn where there is a building!\n\nWhen in a vehicle the driver makes commands whether to turn or to signal a turn signal. Now give the vehicle control and you are giving it control of your life and whatever passengers you have with you. The car is not perfected. It will most likely make countless mistakes. Technology failure being a main one. While you are texting or turned around the engine could die out or the brakes could go haywire. Your instincts will tell you to take the wheel and try to get it under control, what if the commands are inconclussive and won't respond. Who is to blame, the vehicle for shorting out or the driver for becoming too un-alert.\n\nEveryone has their own opinions, everyone has their own brain that allowes them to make the wrong or the right decission based on what they believe.

    "full_text": "Space travel is something we people of Earth have just only begun to tinker with. Even after our many launches of aircrafts into the atmosphere, we know very little of what it truly out in the endless void of space. In the article, \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author suggests that studying Venus specifically is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author would be correct in this statement as we humans know very little about the planet because of numerous factors making it a difficult planet to study, but solving those problems would lead into advancement. Including that becuase the planet is closely related to earth, that could mean it supported life long ago. Lastly that striving to meet the challenge presented, despite the roadblocks, would lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.\n\nThe planet in space we call Venus has a reputation for how troubling it is to study because of numerous factors. As included in the article, Venus has \"A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets...clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid...planet's surface tempurature average of over 800 degrees Fahrenheit...Atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater...\" Venus is an extremely difficult planet to study which is why it would be such an amazing goal to study it fully. If NASA and the people of Earth fight to overpower these issues, we would advance as a species, developing more solutions to fight these problems. By facing the problems presented by Venus, we would finally be able to study it and even find out is there is, or was life on Venus.\n\nIn the article, \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author stated that \"Astromoners are facinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system.\" Shortly after this, they also stated that \"Long ago, Venusm was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth.\" The search for life in space has been one outrageously demanded by the public and Venus may very well be the place to look, after we can penetrate the bounderies it has in store. It was even stated in the article that Venus even has features extremely similar to some found on Earth, furthering the support that Venus could have or does support life. Regardless if Venus supports life or not, if we as a species can get past the barriers of Venus, would lead us into many equaly intimidating endeavors that we can surpass.\n\nThe author sugests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents and supports that when they say, \"Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equaly intimidating endeavors.\" They also say in the next sentence \"Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.\" By surpassing the challenge of Venus, we will have the technology an wisdom to surpass other difficult challenges we may encounter, overall gaining the knowledge and power to gain more knowledge and power.\n\nThe exploration of Venus is indeed a difficult and dangerous task, but in the end would be worth while. By advancing our technologies we can bypass the dangers of Venus and pave the road to move onto even more dangerous and difficult tasks, both on out planet and outside our planet. We could gain the knowledge of how similar Earth and Venus are, finalizing if it could have or did support life at one point in time. And the factors making Venus so dangerous, would be minimalized and surpassed. ",

The author, Nick D'Alto, says this \"if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow.\" he also quotes a Dr. Huang saying \"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming bored or confused or bored.\" Take these two quotes and you imagine a super computer that can learn what you take interest in and modify it's self to your liking.

This technology could be implimented in home schooled children and online classes as well. The reason being as Dr. Huang puts it \"it could modify the lesson...like and effective human instructor.\" This means it would have the power to change lessons if you were not following or just confused. This ability can amplify the process of students learning online or at home.\n\nIn coclussion the technology being able to recognize human emotions will only improve the educational system.

When americans vote they're supposebly voting for the next president, when indeed they're votes only sway the opinion of the elector.\n\nThink back to a little over a decade ago, to the 2000 presidential elections. Al gore received the popular vote, meaning that he was the one that us, the americans had wanted. Due to the fact that George W. Bush, his rival, received more electoral votes, Bush won, leaving an unfavored president running the country. According to source 2, a gallup poll was taken shortly after Gore had lost the presidency, an entire 60 percent of voters would prefer to have a direct vote, rather than go through the electoral process.\n\nGranted, that the electoral college does give a certainty of outcome and that no region on its own can vote for a president, it does give an equal chance for everybody to have their mostly preffered president (according to source 3), there is however some flaws to these so called \"pros\". Faithless electors exist. These electors totally ignore what the people have to say and cast their own vote. This occured in the 1960's with hawaii and louisiana, and when vice president nixon validated only his opponents electors, he made sure to do so without \"establishing a president\", though it can happen again.\n\nWe should all agree with Nixon, carter, and dole on the fact that this system isn't fair. Our voices as individuals aren't heard, and we just vote for the state of electors. We, the people of the united states of America wish to do away with the electoral college.    ",

And the electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party , but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what is their responsibilities are. But the Electoral College it consists or has 538 electors but the majority is to have 270 s that you can vote for the president. By the way once you have voted for the president or senate or governer etc. The system will count how many popular votes or from a vote from Congress and the qualified citizens. But my reason for the electoral college to stay is that once you have voted you can count from the system or it does it for you but if you dont want the electoral college then it will take alot longer for the votes to be process and be accumilated.\n\nWell so there's people or citizen that want the electoral college to keep going but some don't reason to that is in the story this is what it says, \"The electoral college\u00a0 is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostky assertins withoout much basis in reality\". And its unfair cause it has the winner take all system in each state. And they sometimes have problems getting the votes from some states and they couldn't see the candidates at all including Rhode Island and South Carolina and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad. And the story says from someones opinion \"And the arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality.\" And once a state has voten it\u00a0 counts as 1 vote.\n\nAnd some people and the people from the government or like congress,senators,representatives, and more hope that one day while they are voting that the score or number of votes is not a tie. But some citizens arn't into the technology of the electoral vote or how it works. But in that case I would like to not want the electoral collge to keep going mostly due to unfairness, outdated,irrational.\n\nSince the electoral college is still working the method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state-- Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote. But of course no voter's vote swings a national elction, and in spite of that, about one-half the eligible\u00a0 American popluation did vote in 2012's election.       \u00a0       \u00a0       \u00a0    ",

According to the passage,\"Diesel fuel was blamed, since france has... a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline.\" In addition to that, diesel make up 67 percent of vehicles in france. Compared to a 53.3 percent average engines in the rest of western europe. Robert Duffer states that, \"After days of near-record pollution, paris enforced a partical driving ban to clear the air of global city.\" Motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). Moreover, the same goes for odd-numbered plates. With that, the smog cleared enough for the ruling french party.\n\nAll the countries should try a car-free day. Andrew Selsky said, \"In a program that set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during the car-free day.\" Some of the advantages of having a car-free day can help make people see that its not about cars or bikes.

Futhermore, it would help so people can see the world without cars and not pollute the air.\n\nBy giving some of the dangerous stuff that we use daily a break.

Also, many people say that using alternant modes of transportation cut down on the stress they expireinced whilst using a car. In fact, many people are no longer conserned with cars, and young people are begining to stop getting liscenses.\n\nThe smog, which is caused by car emissions, in Paris, France was so intense that the city had to place a partial ban on drivers. Those with even number plates faced a fine if they drove on Monday; and, on Tuesday those ith odd number plates would face the same fine if they drove. The ban was so successful in cutting down the smog that the ban was lifted in time for those with odd number plates to drive unrestricted on Tuesday.( source 2) Paris isn't the only city to place bans on driving, in Bogota, Columbia one day a year the city celebrates the 'Day Without Cars'. The idea of this day is to help reduce smog and has even caught on in Cali and Valledupar, also in Columbia.( source 3)\n\nVauban, Germany makes owning a car unappealing to residents by only allowing two places to park and creating a city plan that facilitates alternative modes of transportation. Many of the residents as a result dont own cars and are happier this way! \"When I had a car I was always tense. Im much happier this way,\" said resident Heidrun Walter. Cities like Vauban are result of a growing trend in Europe called smart planning, which seprates auto use from suburban life.(source 1) People all around the world also feel positive after limited car use. During the Day Without Cars in Columbia Carlos Arturo Plaza states that the day is \" A good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.\" (source 3)\n\nIn 2013 the average miles driven per American was down 9% from the peak of car usage. This may because the Internet allow people to feel connected or possibly because many center cities renewal have made the suburbs less appealing. Whatever the reason, one things for sure, there has been a substancial drop in the amount of 16- to 39-year- olds getting a liscence. (source 4) America isnt the only place to expierence a drop in car usage. Vauban, Germany makes owning a car impractical and 57% of families sold their cars to live there, while 70% dont own cars.

The essay does provide evidence from sources, but the usage, integration, and explanation of that evidence could be improved to support its central argument more effectively. The language usage is also constrained with repeated words, spelling mistakes ('nessecity', 'enviroment', 'expireinced', 'conserned', 'liscenses', 'adavantages'), and grammatical mistakes. Each of these elements makes the essay seem somewhat labored, thus qualifying it for a score of 3"

    "full_text": "Just Straight FACS\n\nAnybody can read a room. Whether it's at a party, an important meeting, a funeral, or a Pre-Calculus lesson at 8 a.m., it's easy to look around and see how the people around you are feeling due to body language and facial expression.\n\nOthers don't think so, though. Prof. Thomas Huang and his team of experts have come up with new tech that can recognize all 44 muscles in the human face, and create a diagnostic on how a person is feeling. This is interesting, yes, but some may think that this technology could be used in classrooms to get a general feel on what each student is feeling about a lesson.\n\nI believe that using the FACS (Facial Action Coding System) in a classroom setting would have no merit and would just be a waste of time and money in public schools across America, because of how weak the technology in the FACS actually is.\n\nIn the text, Dr. Huang says that \"facial expressions for each emotion are universal,\" and that \"varying degrees of expression\" can still be used to recognize the feelings and emotions of any human being. When applying this to a classroom enviroment, this can't be correct. That is due to many natural factors in humans.\n\nFor example, the world has progressed a lot, and more children with mental disabilities and special needs are being allowed to be involved in regular classes. For a student with a form of autism, it may be hard for them to convey certain emotions on a regular basis. The technology wouldn't be able to read their face correctly. Another example is for a student with a physical disability whose face couldn't be read properly by the FACS. There are too many outliers for the technology to be accurate, unless you had a room of children who all express their emotions like an open book.\n\nThe text also says that \"most human communications are nonverbal.\" I agree with this statement, actually. It proves that one can never tell what a person is thinking just by what they say, or their facial expressions. The only true place you can know how somebody really feels is in their mind. I, for one, never really say or express how I feel about school infront of any sort of teacher or staff. It's a general rule among students at my school to onlt talk about teachers or lessons outside of the classroom. Now, this may not be how it is in other public school settings. If it happened to, though, then the FACS technology would be obsolete in its purpose.\n\nLastly, in paragraph 9, the text says that according to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, \"putting on a face\", or a poker face, actually trains your body to be in a better mood. This means that literally anyone could trick the FACS into thinking that they were in a happy mood when need be. Students could easily \"beat the system\" by manipulating the FACS into giving off a false diagnostic every time, and therefore ruining the FACS's credability. Until the FACS can tell when a group of teenagers are faking their emotions, it can't perform its main task.\n\nIn conclusion, Dr.Huang's FACS technology cannot work due to how baseless it's ethics are, how difficult it really is to understand emtions just by facial expression, and how easy it is to manipulate it's process.",

Second, you should not change a photo or use any edits because thats changing you and you should just be you if you dont smile thats okay dont let people judge you on how you look you should impress your self not somebody eles. Third, People today need to realize that changing someone in any type of way could hurt them even worse. Yes, messing with peoples emotion or sometimes trying to figure it out whats wrong with them can set off alot of things. Instead of making someone look happy people should talk to the person that is upset, trying to be there for them maybe thats all they need or tell them soemthing postive to brighten there day.\n\nIn Conclusion, I think changing someones pictures to make them look like they are happy is the wose idea ever because deep down they know they are, but do you just because someone makes and upset face dosnt always mean they are.",

    "full_text": "The Face that is on Mars, is just a natural landform. I am here to prove that it is just a natural landform. All of my reasons will come from the passage named \"Unmasking the Face on Mars.\"\n\nI know that the Face on Mars is just a natural landform because, in the passage it is stated that when the spacecraft Viking 1 was circling it was snapping photos when it spotted a shawdowy figure like a human face on a region on the planet named Cydonia. After that though, scientisits figured out it was just another Martian mesa common around Cydonia. Next, on April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor Camera snapped pictures better than the ones that Viking took. Thousands of peole waited for when the image would first appear on a JPL web site. The website revealed that it was just a natural landform after all. Finally, in the very last paragraph it said, what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. They are similar to landforms common around the American West. A scientist named Jim Garvin said \"it reminds him of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.\" Gavin also stated \"that's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa around the same height as the Face on Mars.\n\nSo therefore, all of the reasons stated above prove that the Face on Mars is just a natural landform.

    "full_text": "Lately there has been a lot of contreversy with ways to elect and which way is more effective and what is preferred by the majority of people. The problem with that is that many people are very biased when it comes to elections. Many poeple are raised with a certain way that their parents might have thought them was correct and that was how they were taught to elect. Although there is not a wrong way to elect, there are more effective and quicker ways to do it. I personally think that the best way to vote would be through popularity.\n\nElectoral College is a \"compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.\". Many people think that Electoral College is rubbish and complicated and I agree. According to paragraph ten in the passage the first sentence says \" Under the electoral college, voters vote not for the President, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.\" which means that it is more of a process to vote through this system. Instead of you inputing your opinion on who you would like to be President you are basically saying that you believe that this slate of electors have a better idea of who would be a better President.\n\nThe electoral college is known to be extremely unfair to voters. In paragraph thirteen the second sentence states \"Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the \"swing\" states.\" which is true because the slate of electors are obviously teams of people who root for the same candidate which gives independent voters close to no chance if they are not voting for the same candidate.\n\nOverall I think that the electoral college way of voting is old and worn out and maybe its time that it went out of business and the popular vote takes its place. With the popularity vote not only do you get to have a chance of choosing the president without the electoral vote canceling out your vote but you also get to go around saying that you're part of the reason why your candidate won. Many people may disagree with me and say that my opinion is not a good opinion but from all of the statements that I have heard, I will still continue to believe that the popularity vote is the best way to vote.

Dispite those facts scientists are still fascinated by the planet do to it's increadible similarity to Earth, but the conditions have prevented scientists from investigating throughly. With all spacecraft sent to Venus being destroyed it is a suprise that we are still trying to study this planet, and the author of \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" gives very little insight into why scientists are still attempting to study the planet.\n\nTo start off Venus is our sister planet with very similar density and size to Earth with similar features with mountains, valleys, and other rocky structures. The author states that many scientists think that Venus could have supported life long ago and may have been covered in ocean and if this is true we may get much insight as to why Venus would change to become an exteremly inhospitable planet. Though the author gives us very little as to what we will be able to do with this information or what other information we may get. The author also mentions space travel but states only that, \"Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for planetary visit, a crusial consideration given the long time frames of space travel\" (\"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" 4). Other than that small mention the author does not go into depth on this idea.\n\nThough the thought of being able to explore and study one of the closes planets to us is great the author of \"The Challenges of Exploring Venus\" does not do to good of a job of informing us as to why we would attempt to weather such harsh conditions.

    "full_text": "In\n\n\"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the debate of the exploration of Venus is exposed for discussion. The article brings up many contriversal topics discussing whether or not Venus is worth exploring. Though most of the article talks about the dangers and overall negativities Venus has to offer when it comes of exploring it, the author takes this information and turns it into postives. The author demonstrates that although Venus is dangerous and almost impossible to explore, attempting to do just that willl be well worth it in the long run. Due to this, the readers can say that the author supported the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers very well.\n\nIn the article, the author first brings up the fact that Venus has a very toxic and dangerous atmosphere. They go on to say that because of this, the conditions in Venus are far to extreme for any human to survive in. Then, the author even posses the question of: Why are scientists trying to explore Venus more if it's so inhospitable? The author uses this question to transition into how they support the exploration of Venus, by saying how despite the inhospitable environment, Venus has many Earth-like qualities which intrigues many astronomers. In the article the author states, \"... Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth.\" This shows that learning more about Venus could potentially be a great advantage to Earth since it's the most similar planet to Earth in the entire solar system.\n\nA second problem the author states about exploring Venus is that every attempt to explore the planet has failed. One reason being is how the extreme heat has prevented each spacecraft to survive for more than a couple of hours on Venus's surface. In the article the author states, \"... no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spacecraft has touched down on Venus in more than three decades.\" The author contradicts this later in the article by explaining the technological advacements that NASA has accomplished to help prevent having another failed mission to Venus. The author states, \"NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions.\" This demonstrates how even though Venus is about impossible to explore, technology can help create smarter alternatives for exploring the planet's surface.\n\nThroughout the article, the author demonstrates that the postives of exploring Venus outweigh the negatives by giving strong evidence as to why the positives eliminate the problems when it comes to exploring Venus's surface. Although there are many major issues with exploring Venus, the author shows the readers that there are solutions that can help fix these problems. Not only does the author do this, but they show how Earth can discover and learn many valuable things about Venus that can help in the long run. So through very strong evidence about the positve that was able to outweigh the negative, the author was able to support the idea of studying Venus very well.  ",

It was discovered by NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft. \"NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face.\" But the Face is just a natural landform discovered on Mars by NASA.\n\nOn April 5, 1998, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team took a picture of the face. It was discovered that there was no alien monument. On paragraph seven, the text states, \"snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos....There was no alien monument after all.\" This proves that they found out the Face was not an alien monument.\n\nBut many people were still not satisfied so, on April 8, 2001, Mars Global Surveyor went to Mars for a second look. On paragraph ten, the text states, \"Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.\" On paragraph twelve, the text states, \"What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa--landforms common around the American West.\" So, the Face that they found on Mars was just a natural landform after all.\n\nUsing evidences from the texts, we learned that the Face was discovered on May 24, 2001. We learned that many people believed it to be an alien monument, but it was not. The Face got looked a second time, on April 8, 2001, but with the camera's absolute \"maximum resolution.\" In the end, they found out that the Face was just a natural landform and not an alien monument.

Yeah i didnt either but i completly agree with the autors point of view on this article i agree about going to venus for more information cause it would help us understand what happened to venus and if one point and time it was like earth.\n\nThe challenge of going to venus with anything is its massive air pressure, solfuric acid rain, and really hot surface temptures and we currently dont have anything to actually be able to survive those condtions for more then maybe three weeks or less so what i say we do is that we look at metals that are restiant to stuff like that and see if we could try combining the atoms to make an alloy.\n\nIn conclusion in my personal opionion i think yes we should try a little harder to get to know more about venus cause it would explain a kot and tell us if one day it was like earth and what happened to it so we could avoid it so that doesnt happen to earth and on top of that the more we learn about it the more the possiblity of it maybe becoming a hospital planet to go to if we need to ever move off of earth.

Most humans are very curios and when they find out there was once life in Venus, it makes us want to go and see what's out there.

Major people are starting to notice,presidents and governements, and are\u00a0 acting apon it. limiting car usage would bring a lot of advavtages such as more pocket money, more excrises and less harm to the earth acorrding to Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in bogota by Andrew Selsky, Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer and the end of car culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal.\n\nCars are defined as a motor vecheil that provides fast transportation for more then one person at a time. thats what most people veiw it as, what that dont know and relize is that it give people a lot more stress to deal with because of either car payments, repairs, or even runing out of gas.\u00a0 acorrding to Heidrun Walter in the passage in german suburb, life goes on without cars she said that when she had a car she was always tense and now that she doesnt have a car sge is more relaxed and is better off without it. she doesnt have to pay for insurance, car payments, repairs on the car and not even gas. that will leave her with a lot of stress free moments.\n\ncars do not only stress out people but they are pulloting the earth. almost all cars run on gas which is put in the car and releases pullotion into the earth. paris had to enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air of pullotion.... that is how much damage it is doing to the earth. it took five days the smog finally rivaled beijing, china which is know as one of the most pullated cities in the world. this could have made people go to the hostiptal because they could have gotten sick or even die from the pullotion. many countries are banning cars for a couple of days each year because of this global problem. according to car-free day is spinning into a big hit in bogota in colombia they have a program that bans cars a for a day which leaves people to walk, hike or even bike to where they need to go. its a good way to take away stress and lower air pullotion said carlos arturo plaza.\n\nfurthermore not only does it help the envirment for limting car usage and gives relief to peopl. it will also make people healther because they would then have to walk, ride or hike to work or any other place thay need to go. this will strength peoples bodies by doing everyday things more often.\u00a0 it would require more work to walk to a destiantion rather then to sit down in a car and press on the brake and gas pedal with our foot. limting car usage will not only make people helthier but it will make people less lazy. for example if a person was lazy and had no food in his/her house they would just easly get in there car and drive to a local fast food restruant to get food. on ther other hand if they did not have a car they would have to walk all the way to the grocery story burning off lots of caliores and buying lots more food rather then stoping at a fast food place just to get a quick meal.\n\nin clonclusion limting car usage would be a more beifical thing to do rather then a problem due to the stress reilf, envimental saftey and healther citzens.

    "full_text": "The so called \" Face'' on mars is just a landform that looks like a face. I know this because there are no such thing as aliens, if aliens did exist we would have seen them and known by now, and lastly I know that I is just a landform because it looks like a coincidental landform that looks like an alien.\n\nThe first reason that I know it is a landform and not an alien is because aliens do not exist. They are some made up characters found in science fiction books and movies, just like monsters, witches, and ghosts. There has never been actual scientific evidence that proved any of those things to be real. Many crazy people think that they have encountered ghost sightings and other things like demons, zombies, or even something as dumb as slenderman. These things are all fantasies that they make up in their heads and then try to get other foolish people to believe them.\n\nThe second reason that I know that it is not an alien is that if aliens and monsters really did exist we would have all known by know. If they were anything like what they are in movies we would all be dead or abducted. In movies people see UFO's and they suddenly are sucked up into a portal and abducted by aliens and used as slaves. If they existed you would think that many people would probably have gone missing after \"UFO\" sightings. Like I said before it is just a bunch of nonsence that people have made up in their head and aren't smart enough to know that it isn't true.\n\nMy last reason that I know it isn't an alien is because I know that landforms can often look like things that they really aren't. For example at my uncles house they have a big rock in their back yard that looks a lot like a ground hog. I know that it is not a ground hog, but if I was like the people that thought it was an alien I could make up a bizare story about how in ancient times the ground hog got cursed and then was turned into a rock because the king demanded it to.\n\nSee? It just doesn't make much sence.\n\nSure, the landform looks somewhat like a face in the 1976 picture, but so did the rock in my uncle's back yard. All the thoughts of it being an alien is so made up in their heads. The NASA crew said, \"Nasa's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2, when when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. An enormous heaad nearly two miles for end to end seemed to be staring at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. First off, the aliens in sci-fi movies aren't nearly two miles long, not even close to that. Secondly where it says that the head seemed to be staring up at them, obviously if you are above it and it's a 2d or 3d shape it's going to appear to be looking at you!\n\nIn conclusion there is no way that the so called face on mars is an alien. It's not an alien because aliens don't exist, we would have known by now it aliens really existed, and some landforms are shaped like odd things. Like I said earlier, if aliens really existed we would have encountered them before and seen UFO's that would try to abduct us. This is why there are no such things as aliens, which means the face on mars is just a landform that just so happens to look like a face. ",

    "full_text": "Should venus be explored? There are many different aspects, and opinions on the subject, but the author gives us very good reasons why it should be explored and studied. One of the reasons is that belive it or not venuse is the most simalar planet to earth, also the scientist at NASA said they are working on a blimp like vehicle that could go up to 30 miles high. That means if they made this structer they could avoid all of the harsh conditions on ground level at venus such as the armospheric pressure, and the unbarable heat that is a crazy total of 800 degrees. If they would make this vehicle the pressure would drop substantionaly and so would the heat from 800 degrees to around 170 degrees, the solar power and radation would also be very plentiful and wouldn't exceed Earth levels. The conditions would definetly no be easy to deal with, but they would at least be survivable. There is one problem thought people at NASA can not document their finding because of conditions which would make it where cameras could not be used. This is because the most the light cannot penetrate the dense atmospher. But there maybe a solution, the thing is we might just have to go back in time. For example scientists are looking back on older technology, this technology would be mechanical computers, this is good because these computers do not requier any technology, they use gears and levers and would be substainable on venus. That is how the author suggests that the study of venus should be pursued. As it said in the artical dont look at it such as dangers just bigger challenges.",

    "full_text": "Driverless Cars\n\nDriverless cars are coming in the future. In the future, no one will probably need to buy cars because they won't need them. According to Google cofounder Sergey Brin, that will happen. He sees a future with a public transportation system where fleets of driverless cars form a public- transport taxi system. The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus. There are many great things about driveless cars, but there are some bad things as well.\n\nDriverless cars are really beneficial. Driverless cars have way more senors and alerts than regular cars. For example, if the car is about to back up into an object, the driver's seats will vibrate to let you know. Also, within the past 10 years, sensors on the driverless cars have become way more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers. The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone.\n\nDriverless cars are also very safe to use. The cars can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mile per hour, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel. Even though the word \"driverless\" may scare you, none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. Which means you are still somewhat in control of the car. The cars may be able to steer, accelerate and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents. The driver must stay alert and be ready to take over when the time comes. The car can quickly get the driver's attention whenever a problem occurs. GM has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. Other options under consideration are flashing lights on the windshield and other heads-up displays. Basically, while the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver. (Paragraph 7)\n\nDriverless cars are going to become the next big thing. They won't just become beneficial to you, but everyone else as well. The cars would only use half the fuel that today's taxi use. Which is a huge deal because we as a whole, we use a lot of fuel. Also, it will offer more flexibility than a bus. Just imagine that. Google cofounder Sergey Brin believes these such cars would fundamentally change the world, and everyone else should believe that too. (Paragraph 1)\n\nSome people may agrue that letting a car be in control is just absurb. You never know what the car might do. It could end up causing you to end up in a wreck, or maybe it won't slow down and the brakes won't work. Even though you are alert, what can you do if something goes wrong? Nothing. If the car can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves there is not a whole lot you can do to stop it. You just never know with a driverless car. You are putting yourself ar risk while you are in the car because you are not 100% in control of the car and that is not safe.\n\nIn conclusion, driverless cars are very safe and have major benefits. Some people may be scared of letting a car be in a control, instead of them being in control of the car. But no one should have nothing to worry about. As long as you stay alert, you should be fine. Even though the car can do many things by itself, it still sends you heads up when it needs your assistance. Driverless cars coming very soon in the near future. Try them and see how they are.",

Without cars in our lives many people would be lost and not know what to do. Thinking of a world without cars is\u00a0unreasonable to the\u00a0people of\u00a0today, but if they\u00a0thought of all the good not driving everyday does for the world then it would probably be a different story.\n\nMany places are enforcing\u00a0people\u00a0to go without there cars transporting them\u00a0everyday, which could be a good thing. Heidrun Walter a man in source 1 states, \"Seventy percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and fifty-seven percent sold a car to move here.\" By saying this he is showing how many people like living their lives without all the troubles cars can cause. People of this community dont have to worry about being ran over by cars or being stuck in traffic everyday. David Goldberg, another man in source 1 also states, \"All of our development since World War two has been centered on the car, and that will have to change.\" In saying this he portraying that\u00a0we need to focus\u00a0on more important things and\u00a0stop\u00a0worrying\u00a0about cars, which hurt us more in the long run than they do helping us.\n\nVauban isn't the only place that has enforced the rule of not using cars. Many other places have done so also.\u00a0Robert Duffer states, \"After days of near-record pollution, paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.\" By saying this the author is explaining\u00a0how the use of cars have dramatically polluted a city. Just think, if there were no cars, then there would be less pollution to worry about hurting all the city's. It is not hard to ride a bike to the places you need or want to go. Instead of using cars everyday and hurting our enviroment, people should think of how much good they would be doing and money they would be saving by taking another type of transportation than just cars.\n\nBogota, Colombia has also taken the no car use into affect. They have used many other types of transportion such as hiking, biking, and even skating to there destination. Businessman Carlos Arturo from source 3 says, \"It's a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.\" He and many other citizens of this place agree with saving our enviroment and not using cars. Not using cars is less stressful because your not consistently worring about gas, the car breaking, or getting into an accident with another driver.\n\nJust imagine your life without using a car everday. Not using\u00a0a car isn't that\u00a0bad and doesnt hurt you or the people around you as much as it does having one. Using a car everyday puts your life at risk, takes your money, and hurts the enviroment.\u00a0Life without cars would be simpler and less stressful in our world today.       \u00a0       \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0       \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0    ",

One deatil to support my claim is that in the story it says \" for instance you can probably tell how a friend is feeling by the look on their face , of course most of us would have troube actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy or sad. That means that with the facial scan computer they acn do it with no hassle at all.\n\nAnother reason that the new facial action coding system could help is because it can tell if people have mixed emotoins.

    "full_text": "Do you think you would be able to live without your car? It would be less difficult than you think! In fact, there is a whole town named Vauban, Germany, that has given up their cars! According to Source 1, street parking, driveways, and home garages are generally forbidden, unless of course you have the money to buy a parking garage space for a whopping $40,000. A citizen of the car-less town, Heidrum Walter admits, \"When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way.\" Passenger cars are resposible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50 percent in some areas of the US, according to Source 1. If only we had more towns like Vauban, maybe our impact on the world would be less destructive.\n\nSome towns ban cars for a few days at a time. Paris enforced a partial driving ban after days of near-record pollution. Congestion in Paris went down 60 percent and the smog from the pollution cleared up enough that they rescind the ban. Some people would complain that having little to no cars will be an issue for jobs, delivery companies, or getting children to and from places. There's always a bus, and there's always the option of car pooling! Bogota, Columbia is another town that has done a car free day, except Bogota's is annual. These Columbians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to places during the car-free day, according to Source 3. Businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza says, \"It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.\" As a result of this annual car-free day, 118 miles of bicycle paths have been constructed in Bogota. I think more towns should ban cars for just a few days. We could all get a little excersize, help the environment, and improve our mood and lower stress!\n\nA recent study found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009, Source 4 says. The number of miles driven in the US was at it's height in 2005 and dropped steadily after. In April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was almost 9 percent below that peak! Some sociologists believe that if this pattern continues, it will have lots of beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, according to Source 4. Some places, such as New York, have car-sharing programs and bike-sharing programs, which is a nice way to get from place to place that's healthy for you and your environment.\n\nThere's so many reasons why we should use our cars less! Like I explained, it's very healthy for your environment, and if you choose to walk or bike, its healthy for your body, too. Also, pollution rates would go down quite a lot if we would just carpool or walk/bike to places! People have said that they feel so much happier and stress free from not using a car all the time. So why not take the time to help your environment and call somebody up to carpool, get that bike fixed, or hop on that bus!       \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0       \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    ",

Now software has developed that could help you do just that. The Fcial Action Coding System has applications that will be extraordinary to modern day technology.\n\nDr. Huang and Dr. Eckman created the the FACS. All which have six emotions-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. These are emotions that are used on a daily basis around the world so they are pretty basic. Video imagery is used that tracks one's facial movements. Therefore it can identify mixed emotions. The video imagery compares each expression with a neutral face in order to figure your emotions.\n\nImagine being at school on your classroom computer learning something boring, and all of a sudden the topic becomes fun. Dr. Huang predicts that your classroom computer could recognize when a student is confused or bored. It would be useful to many students in order to make and help them learn better. This same technology could make identifying emotions much easier. The boring lesson for you would modify. This way the computer will know to keep giving you boring lessons or fun ones.\n\nFacial muscles are obviously an important item in this. If the technology could not identify the way your facial muscles move, then the technology would not work. Not only do your muscles express emotion, but they also help produce them. The article states that a renowned drama coach, Constantin Stanislavsky, had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotions on stage. This clearly would help the actors express themselves better, thanks to our face muscles. People may not notice, but we imitate other people's facial expressions with empathy.\n\nWho would have thought that sience and technology could be involved with a big feature of who we are. Sometimes being able to figure how someone is feeling. At times we may even have to bug them in order to figure the emotion. Now with the new technology of FACS, this task will be easier.

Driverless cars have been around for a while now; even though they are not fully developed they are becoming more and more relavent and it's time to imbrace that. Imbrace that they may even help prevent any sort of crash in the future. While also getting people to thier destinations fast and saftely.\n\nThere are still problems to face even in the light of things. For example.\n\n\"Most driving laws focus on keeping drivier, passengers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers. Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. As a result, in most states t is illegal even to test computer driven cars.\" There are still many strides to take in acheving driverless cars on rode but as soon has those obsticles are tackled everyone will be much happier.

As soon\n\nhas the laws have been made the states wil also be more open the idea of a drverless car on thier streets.\n\nHas stated earlier there are still a few problems with the idea of driverless cars but they are really close to frution. Possibly even on the cusp on perfection. \"In fact, none of the cars developed so far are completly driverless. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the rode ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents. This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires.\"\n\nAll of that simply means driverless cars are not 100 percent driverless but they very very close. If they can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves thats half the battle and the rest will follow in suite with time.\n\n\"Google's modified Toyota Prius uses postion-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotatng sensor on the roof, a video camera mountedd near the rearview mirrior, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS reciver, and an inertial motion sensor. The most impportant bit of technology in this system is the spinn sensor on the roof. Dubbed LIDAR, it uses laser beams to form a constanctly uppdating 3-D model of the car's surrondings.\" The technology is there for the drverless cars to start becoming a real prossiblity in the near future. They may even fully take over and allow for a much more easy going experinces while driving. And also allow for beyond human level control of the ride.\n\n\" Telsa has prjected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on the autopilot 90 percent of the time. Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plam to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020. The rode to the truly autonomous car stretches on ahead of us. but we grow closer to the destination everyday.\" Fully driverless cars really are in the near future. There are small little pushes that still must be made but right around the corner of those is a paradise of safe relaxing transportation for all to use.

Maybe you should try walking because cars tend to cause damage to our environment. We the people should try limiting driving because if we do we won't have pollution,we wouldn't have to deal with smog,and even better protect our environment. Greenhouse gas has reduced since automobiles were limited in the suburbs.\n\nLimiting cars could have a great impact on reducing air pollution. Countries such as China are known as one of the most polluted countries due to th amount of gas it uses. A businessman Carlos Arturo said \"It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,\"this identifies that people actually care about pollution. Pollution can also be bad for us humans because not only does it affect our breathing but it can also led to death due to the types of chemicals that we take in. Paris is a city who has dealt with smog and took care of the situation really quickly.\n\nSmog is a major factor why people all around the world are either limiting driving or even banning cars with in the region. An example of that would be Paris who had were near a record day setting of pure smog. The effect of this led Paris to enforce a partial driving ban to clear air of the global city. Motorist were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer the consequences by getting fined 22-euros. This difference led to a congestion which went down to about 60 percent in the capital of France. Animals have suffered the most since cars started to evolve or became more useful.\n\nThe environment in which we live in has suffered consequences as well. Organizations such as the Environmental Protection Agency are stepping in to help out within the community. They started to propmote car reducing due to the 80 percent of approprations by law have gone to highways and the rest towards other transportations.\n\nNow you see why we should start walking instead of driving because its good for our health but the main reason is that it limits driving. It also reuces pollution as well as smog, and keeps the environment clean. Are you willing to sacrifice your driving addiction for the sake of human kind and our animals.       \u00a0    ",

    "full_text": "Since the beginning of time people have always wanted the next big thing. After watching many movies where cars that don't need drivers are being used, people have wanted to make this a reality. Since 2009 there have been cars that could drive independently under certain conditions (paragraph 2). However, by making these driverless cars legal it makes driving even more dangerous.\n\nIn paragraph 7 it states ,\" This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires.\" After drivers get use to this car they will be more relaxed and not as alert as usual. It will be easy for drivers to drift off or get distracted. This is because the car is doing most of the work. This could cause many wrecks that could injure not only the driver, but others on the road too.\n\nWhen driving a driverless car many drivers would not be aware of their surroundings. In paragraph 8 it says , \" Such displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over - something not available to drivers trying to text with a cell phone. In this way the in-car system is actually a saftey feature.\" If drivers are texting while using a Driverless car , then it means they are not paying attention. In an emergency the driver would not have enough time to stop. If a child or animal ran out infront of the car, it would be to late. The driver would not have enough time to react and stop the car. The car would not have enough time to alert the driver.\n\nAnother con about a driverless car is who to blame when an accident occurs. Paragraph 9 states ,\" If technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?\" Many car accidents take place each day, which means the odds of a driverless car getting in an accident are probably pretty likely. If this did occur the driver could blame the manufacture saying that the car didn't alert the driver. The manufactures could blame the driver by saying that any driver of a driverless car must always be alert. This now affects not only the driver, but the manufactures and the other people in the accident.\n\nDriverless cars would make roads even more dangerous and unsafe. They give drivers an excuse to not pay attention to the road and the things around them. This could cause very serious accidents. It is safest if cars remain where drivers are always in control. ",

The second reason is because under the Electoral college system, voters vote not for president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.

    "full_text": "Fellow Citizens, there are many reasons why limiting car usgage has outstanding oppritunities and advantages.\n\nFor an example, If there aren't people out there spending their hard earned money that they worked for, for an\u00a0expensive car that they are just going to use to get to someplace faster when they could just stop being lazy for once and walk or run, ride bikes, hike, or take a bus, instead of spending money after money to fill a car up to just waste gas, and to fill it up again. Running, riding bikes, hiking, etc. gives you a chance to experience reality. Being outside gives people a chance to see the earths real beauty, and to smell the fresh air. Limiting car usage helps people stay in shape and keeps them healthy if their not just sitting in a car for half a hour when they could be running or walking.\n\nResidents\u00a0in Vauban, Germany are permitted car ownership, but there are only two places to park : large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home. About 70 percent of Vauban's families do not iwn cars, an about 57 percent sold a car to move there. Having a car makes peoples tense, and being in a place where there isnt alot of car usgae makes people much happier. People who live in places where cars arent used as oftn as other states, those towns place stores in walking distance, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.\n\nAn amazing advantage\u00a0that people can can from limiting the usage of cars is less drunk drivers, or even none. If there's less drunk drivers, there's less car crashes and less deaths. Everyone understands that you have to be 21 or\u00a0older in most states to drink alcoholic beverages. The big adavntage out of this is, if older people were to get drunk, they would be forced to call a cab, or even walk home. Their not putting noone else's life in danger, and this would\u00a0lower the crashes and\u00a0death fatalities per year.\n\nAs as many cars that there is in the world, all the use of them would probably pollute the world. Paris enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city after days of the near-record pollution.\n\nLimiting car usage gives you the oppritunity to be with your family and friends and spend more time with them\u00a0then you normally would having a car. You can walk and talk with them on the way to work, you can stop by the park and have some fun on your way to the grocery store. The best part about this is, you dont have to worry about the roads being busy. You ca walk, run, hike, and bike without having to hear the noisy streets, the honking, the screeching, etc.\n\nWhat's the point in having a car that your just going to be wasting money on, when running, walking or riding a bike is free and even\u00a0cheaper and safer than driving a car. What are you gonna do when your car breaks down? Are you gonna keep spending your money on when it keeps breaking? Why do that when you have two\u00a0perfectly good and healthy legs and you can run or walk somewhere?\n\nJust take a moment to think about the fines every single person breathing in the world has received? Alot of money wasted on something idiotic huh? just imagine if every state, continents, islands, and places we dont know about all stopped using cars, or even just limited the car usage. We'd be saving a whole ton of money, we'd basically all be middle classes.\n\nThis whole situation is a win-win, You get to be with your family 24/7, Running, walking, biking, hiking etc. is all an amazing\u00a0way to keep people healthy. People dont have to worry about drunk drivers, or car crashes, or car fatalities. People can finally stop spending their hard earned money that they're just going keep spending and wasting on gasoline or to fix your car when its having problems and it breaks. Families can save the money that they would normally be spending on gasoline and start saving for a trip to take their family on to spend more time with them, or to take a trip for yourself.\n\nThere are plently more reasons and outstanding advantages that limiting car usage gives you, but these are some of the very best! Just remember, The only good advantages a car can give you is getting you somewhere faster, and keeping you comfortable and safe. But they are also the most danagerous, and expensive things out there. They can take your life or someone elses in an instant, and they can put you in debt quicker than you know! Limitng car usage is for you!    ",

One of the reason i think this way is becuase teachers should not have to use a machine is read their students emotions by simple just asking a student on how he or she feels can get the same results. Another reason is the money for a machine like this is very costy, and not every school could afford a machine like this. Also the machine is and invination of privites and some students might not want their emotions read\n\nMost students are under stress by school work and the could easly be read by anyone and it would be a waste of the schools money to read the emotion of a student. Also the student could be sad, angery, or happy about something totally differant from school work, and that means it could throw the machine off.\n\nI think the Facial Action Coding System should not be used in schools and never should be.

Administrators could use this information about the students to adjust there learning programs to make the lessons more interesting for the students. The computer can even go beyond classroom problems to mental health issues.

Once students understand how there technology works they will began expressing themselves through culture, Litilarcery, and so much more. In the article \" Making Mona Lisa Smile\" it says \" She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted,6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry.\" This allows some computer software to recognize emotions.\n\nFacial expressions are a very important detail in every individuals life. Reading someones facial expression can tell you what you need to do next. For example in paragragh 4 it says \" The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,\" observes Dr. Huang, \" even though individuals oftem show varying degrees of expression\" (like not smiling as broadly).\" So when your friends mad and doesnt want you near her or shes just confused, now you'll know your next step.\n\nEmotions are not just expressions on ones face but body movement as well. Body Language plays an important roll in facial expressions. In paragragh 3 it tells us \"Eckman has classified six basic-emotion shappiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movents of the facial muscles.\" For example when your angery your orbicularis oris which is the place around your mouth, it tightens your lips up to show your emotion.\n\nThe use of technology to read emotional expressions are very important.

I feel like this could go agaisnt someones privacy and the way others can view them in certain different ways they did before. I don't believe that people should use technology to figure out if someone is feeling sad, happy, angry, confused etc.. because it is there privacy and not for anyone else to know unless you tell them so.\n\nAnother reason I can give is that the technology is almsot pointless when we can do this ourselves, they say it themselves \"For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling by the simple look on their face\" The technology isnt needed when we can do this with our very own two eyes, The point of the techhnology is to give an accurate hypothosis of how we are feeling when we can give that just by talking to someone. There has been times where I've been texting people and know what there emotions is like just by texting them, when we get to know someone well enough we can sense if something is bothering them. This technology on the other hand takes that part of building a relationship with someone to a lower level, you would already know their emotions even in the classroom.\n\nThe last example I have is the fact that people can fake there emotons and people do it all the time. It is a tendency and human nature to put on a mask to hide if we are sad or hurt by something because at times we dont wanna hurt people. We could hide the way we feel all we want, because the computer doesnt know whats on the inside, it knows whats on the outside, which in another example in the first sentence saying \"She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry\" That is an example of the Leonardo Da Vinvi's \"Mona lise\" the question I have is how do we know thats how she actually feels? He doing a portait not telling her to show how she really feels while he paints. What I am getting at is, it is easy to put on a mask when everything does feel okay.\n\nIn conclusion, I don't think this technology is a bad idea, but I feel like it is not needed when we can figure it out just as much the computer can, just maybe not as on point so to speak, but it is someones privacy and not anyones elses unless the person chooses to say.",

Curosity is always on are minds for an example how many candies do you think are in that jar? or how did you make that object fit when it seems impossible to make it fit, and many more that makes us wanting to know more. \" Astronomers are facianted by Venus because it may well once have been most Earth- like planet on are solar system.\n\nLong ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth. Today, Venus still has some features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. \" Wouldn't that be amazing to know how close or different Plant Venus could be to are planet earth. Only trying will get us to are answers.       ",

    "full_text": "No, i do not agree with America creating \"driverless\" cars . Depending on a machine to navigate the roads and sucessfully take you to your destination is an accident waiting to happen litterally. Who would be at fault if a wreck were to accure? Would you really be able to have piece of mind while letting your car do the driving?\n\nFirst, you have to think about who would really be at fault if an accident happened. In the article it states that \"if technology fails and someone is injured who is at fault - the driver or the manufacturer?\" Well it would be challenging to understand that fully, because if something were to happen with one or more sensors malfunctioning, than how can you blame the driver in that case? The maufaturing companies would have to run numerous tests and double check to insure that all of the sensors and gadgets on the vehicle are in working order and stay that way so they deliver a safe product on their part. At the time of the wreck, you will have to take into concideration what each driver was doing, and the steps leading up to the event to come to a conclution of who fault it is.\n\nSecondly, the cars arent 100% driverless, you still have to take over the wheel when need be. When in these cars, the driver has to give his/her full attention at all times, so you might as well be in an ordinary vehicle. A quote from the text states \"their cars have driven more than a million miles without a crash but sofar, Google's cars arent trully driverless; they alert the drivers to take over the when pulling in and out of drive ways or dealing with complicated issues, such as navagating through road work or accidents.\" Having to take over when their is a contruction zone or driveways etc, is not the deffinition of a full driverless car to me.\n\nlastly, the cars have fancy sensors and other tools and whatnot , but these cars still call for human skills. Driverless cars are intelligent but may not be able manage a situation if you were to look down at your phone quickly or something else along the lines of that. The information states that \"they can steer, accelerate and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road requires human skills. You have to stay focused on the road and guide the car if needed in a situation. if you want to not stay locked on the road and do another thing while in the car, these vehicles are not for you.\n\nIn conclusion, i do not approve of these inventions until it is proved that they are 100% safe and until you dont have to pay attention to driving the whole time. Driverless cars still need the skill of a human behind the wheel, they arent fully driverless and something may not work in proper order, and also you have to think about who would be at fault if a wreck happened. These are all things we need to take into concideration before going out and purchasing one of these new vehicles.

    "gpt_response": "$$3$$. This essay is an example of independent writing as it doesn't specifically reference multiple sources in its argument. The essay demonstrates developing mastery but has notable weaknesses. It presents an understandable critique of driverless cars, but its examples are either vague or repetitive, leaving the critique underdeveloped. Specifically, the argument could be expanded upon with research or facts about driverless cars' performance and safety tests or different perspectives on liability issues. The organization and focus of the essay are somewhat limited, as it repeatedly circles back to safety and control issues without clicking the debate further. Language usage is simple and effective, although it includes grammar errors and spelling mistakes, somewhat distracting from the essay's overall clarity. The spelling errors (like 'accure' instead of 'occur', 'concideration' instead of 'consideration') and grammatical issues (\"a contruction zone\", \"something may not work in proper order\") indicate a need for more careful proofreading.",
